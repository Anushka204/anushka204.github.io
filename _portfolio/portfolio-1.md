## Project Description

NotesVerb is a scalable backend system designed using microservices architecture to support a high-performance note-taking platform. The system separates core functionalities into independent services to improve scalability, maintainability, and performance.

The application includes dedicated services for authentication, notes management, and notifications, all connected through an API Gateway. Redis caching is implemented to reduce database load and improve response time. The entire system is containerized using Docker and orchestrated using Kubernetes to ensure high availability and efficient deployment.

## Key Features
- Secure authentication using JWT
- Independent microservices architecture
- Redis caching for optimized performance
- API Gateway routing and service communication
- Containerized deployment using Docker and Kubernetes

## Technologies Used
Node.js, PostgreSQL, Redis, Docker, Kubernetes, REST APIs

## Impact & Learning
- Learned distributed system design principles
- Gained hands-on experience in microservices deployment
- Improved backend performance optimization techniques
